This is Maya script for converting the frame by frame geometry animation(Such as simulated fluid, animated photogrammetry model)to the scale based animation.  
Optimize the frame rate 15 fps for web or mobile usage. Also this script will rearragne the UV layout.  
So that meshes can share textures and materials over the frames, which helps to reduce the number of drawcalls.

Originally this script designed for SparkAR studio usage  
however the result FBX animation can be used any engines that uses FBX file.
